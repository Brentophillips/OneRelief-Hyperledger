# Humanitarian Blockchain Trial

OneRelief's **Innovation Lab** is building an experimental Hyperledger **blockchain network** and a simplified **user interface** for humanitarian organizations to test, to evaluate how organiztions and donors can carry out IATI compliant information sharing transactions via blockchain.

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard created by the [International Aid Transperancy Initiative](http://iatistandard.org) used today by over 600 humanitarian and development organizations, major donors and government development agencies.

[OneRelief](https://onereliefapp.com) is a nonprofit initiative building a next-generation charitable application collecting micro-donations for humanitarian organizations involved in crisis response. OneRelief launched an **Innovation Lab** to study ways of leveraging technology and emerging open data sharing frameworks like IATI to improve humanitarian financing.

## Hyperleger

Hyperledger is a blockchain technology incubator created by the [Linux Foundation]() developing blockchain tools and frameworks like **Hyperledger Composer**, a prototyping tool, and **Hyperledger Fabric**, a modular framework engineered for building blockchain network applications.

Blockchain developers use Hyperledger Composer to architect and test Hyperledger Fabric components, in many cased adapted from component templates (known as Business Network Definitions or **BND**s) defining data models, transaction logic and access control rules designed for different blockchain use cases.

## Focus

OneRelief's Innovation Lab will **focus** on:

* Build rudimentary blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and a simplified blockchain user interface
* Use Hyperledger composer to initially develop and test the network’s data models, transaction logic and access control rules using information sharing **scenarios** as design templates
* Recruit and guide participating humanitarian organizations through testing the network and user interface for a set period of time, then make the network availible to organizations to use for their own development and testing
* Making knowhow and code generated by the project openly accessible to others, including an **IATI Network Definition** for Hyperledger Composer

## Scenarios

OneRelief’s Innovation Lab is particularly interested in giving humanitarian organizations an opportunity to try a blockchain user interface and see how basic IATI compliant information sharing exchanges or **scenarios** can look documented in a blockchain ledger.

The project is particularly interested in examining and developing the **code** necessary to process common informational transactions linking organizations and donors, including secured exchanges using **smart contracts** to limit information sharing.
