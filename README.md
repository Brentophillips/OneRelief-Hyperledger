# Hyperledger - Innovation Lab Project

[OneRelief](https://onereliefapp.com) is a nonprofit initiative building an innovative new charitable application collecting micro-donations for humanitarian organizations involved in crisis response.

OneRelief's **Innovation Lab** is experimenting with using blockchain technology to document disbursements made to humanitarian partners using information fields compliant with the **IATI Standard**.

[IATI](http://iatistandard.org) is an open data sharing standard and technical framework that humanitarian organizations and donors use to share detailed information about aid activities, transactions and results and make the information accessible to machine applications.

A **Hyperledger** is a blockchain style ledger developed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) project in partnership with leading tech companies like [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/hyperledger.html) and other partners.

Learn more about the Hyperledger Playground and the code that this project will develop ([Video]()).

## Research Focus

The innovation lab will undertake to:

* Setup an experimental hyperledger linking OneRelief and humanitarian organizations interested in testing blockchain technology ([Participant List]())
* Create a rudimentary reporting interface for each participant ([Interface]())
* Track micro-disbursements made to the organizations ([Blockchain Record]()) funding reported activities.

Hyperledger research will enable OneRelief to develop a hyperledger to integrate into OneRelief's backend architecture.

## Scenarios

OneRelief's Hyperldeger projet will initially concentrate on using IBM's [Bluemix Hyperledger Playground](http://composer-playground.mybluemix.net) to mockup a host of blockchain reported scenarios generated from simulated IATI aid activity files.

The Lab will undertake to research the scenerios and use IATI XML to generate script files needed to plug into the Hyperledger Playground to simulate the given scenerio, creating Hyperledger blocks to view.
