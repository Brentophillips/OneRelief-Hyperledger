# OneRelief - Hyperledger Project

**OneRelief** is building an experimental **Hyperledger** and a simple **user interface** for humanitarian organizations and donors to test ([participants]()).

The project will concentrate on using IBM's [Hyperldger Composer Playground]() to work out how a humanitarian blockchain application can turn aid activity, transaction and results information reported by organizations and donors in compliance with the IATI Standard, based on common reporting [scenarios](), into **blockchain records** visible via a [transaction log]().

Code generated by the project will help developers to build humanitarian blockchain applications while the project itself will give humanitarian actors an unique and easy opportunity to test a blockchain user interface and see their data put to use to help raise operational funding.

## Background

[OneRelief](https://onereliefapp.com) is a nonprofit initiative building a charitable application collecting micro-donations from the crowd for humanitarian organizations involved in crisis response.

OneRelief's **Innovation Lab** is studying how blockchain technology developed for example by the **Linux Foundationâ€™s** [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) initiative in partnership with leading tech companies like **IBM** can be applied to serve the humanitarian community and power next-generation humanitarian crowdfunding platforms.

**IATI** is an open data sharing standard and technical framework created and managed by the [International Aid Transperancy Initiative]() to make detailed information about humanitarian aid activities, transaction and results more transparent and accessible to machine applications. IATI is used today by over 600 organizations and is mandated by a growing number of government development agencies.
